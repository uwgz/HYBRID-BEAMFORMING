# Massive MIMO Hybrid Beamforming Simulation

This MATLAB simulation explores Massive MIMO systems with a focus on hybrid beamforming techniques. It compares the spectral efficiency and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of fully digital and hybrid beamforming approaches under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

## Overview

Massive MIMO systems utilize a large number of antennas at both transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) to improve communication performance. Hybrid beamforming combines analog (RF) and digital beamforming to exploit Massive MIMO benefits with reduced complexity.

## Features

- **Antenna Configuration**: 64 Tx antennas with 4 RF chains and 16 Rx antennas with 4 RF chains.
- **Scattering Model**: Simulates a rich scattering environment with multiple clusters and rays.
- **Beamforming Weights Calculation**: Computes optimal and hybrid beamforming weights based on channel state information.
- **Performance Analysis**: Compares spectral efficiency and BER of fully digital and hybrid beamforming schemes across various SNR levels.

## graphs

- **Spectral Efficiency vs. SNR**: This analysis showcases how efficiently the communication system can transmit data at different SNR levels, comparing the capacity of fully digital and hybrid beamforming setups.
- **BER vs. SNR**: By examining the BER across various SNRs, the simulation highlights the reliability and error resilience of the communication system under both beamforming techniques.
